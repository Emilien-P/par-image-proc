##Par-Image-Processing
The aim of this little project is to use scala meter library to measure the differance of performance between a straight forward single processor image processing code in scala and its counterpart using parallel collections.

The image processing part consists in doing a scharr operation on an image. The core is adapted from an other project I had done written in java.
